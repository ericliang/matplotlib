Software required to build the users guide

  matplotlib - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net
  latex - http://www.latex-project.org
  ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org
  graphviz    - http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz
  PIL - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil

To build the matplotlib users guide, you will need to 

  * PIL - some of the examples use it to show how to interact with
    matplotlib and PIL (cut and paste of the following if you are on a
    linux-like box and are a sudoer)

      cd /var/tmp/
      wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.4.tar.gz
      tar xvfz Imaging-1.1.4.tar.gz
      cd Imaging-1.1.4/
      cd libImaging/
      ./configure ; make
      cd ..
      sudo python setup.py install

  * add the styles dir to your TEXINPUTS environment variable.  Eg,  

      setenv TEXINPUTS .:/home/jdhunter/matplotlib/users_guide/styles:/usr/share/texmf//

    Note the double slash at the end tells TeX to recusively search
    that dir.


  * Generate the figures 
     
     > make figs

    Verify that the figures in the figures dir are built.  Verify also
    that the *.dat files in data were built.

  * graphviz - the graphviz program is used to make some diagrams.
    You will need a working version of "dot", from the graphiviz
    suite.  To generate the dot graphs

    > make graphs

    You will also need the ImageMagick convert tool to conver the dot
    ps output to PNG

  * build the docs

    > make dvi
    > make pdf

 Typing make will build all of the figures, graphs and output formats
 for the users guide
